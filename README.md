Intership program QA Manual on Prometheus portal

In this repository are presented 12 tasks that reflect 12 weeks of work on a real project - testing an online store selling e-scooters SKYBOT

During the project, 3 versions of the web portal were presented, which can be seen in the following links:

1 - the first one - https://prometheusqastage1.wixsite.com/skybot
2 - second version - https://prometheusqastage2.wixsite.com/skybot
3 - third version (the last one) - https://prometheusqastage3.wixsite.com/skybot

Below, I will present the short description of each week.
<p>
1 week - we analysed the importance of the first-level requirements using the Fibonacci scale; and evaluated the second-level requirements for their consistency with the logic according to the evaluation criteria.
</p>
<br>
<p>
2 week - developed initial test documentation (test plan) for the overall organisation of the testing process.
</p>
<br>
3 week - get acquainted with the developed version of the portal and check the MVP (minimum viable product) for compliance with the customer's requirements, which were agreed upon during the first sprint, and determine what initial tests should be performed for the MVP of the portal.
<br>
4 week - creating test coverage based on the test scenario developed during Sprint 3, which includes the process of determining which parts of the programme code have been executed.
<br>
5 week - performed smoke-testing of the initial version of the portal and wrote a report on the test results.
<br>
6 week - tested the portal using the previously created test cases in Sprint 4 and described the results in Jira. We determined the complexity of the test cases and sorted them.
<br>
7 week - functional testing - checking the functions, operations and capabilities of the web portal by the test team to ensure its correct operation.
<br>
8 week - Non-functional testing of the portal - assessed the quality of system attributes that are not related to the direct functionality of the product. This testing included tests for performance, scalability, reliability, security, compatibility, and other characteristics that affect user satisfaction and overall system performance.
<br>
9 week - re-test та regression testing (perform a bug fix check and verify that no new bugs have been introduced after the fixes)
<br>
10 week - end-to-end testing of the last version (developed scenarios that cover the entire life cycle of interaction with the system, including data entry, operations, processing and output)
<br>
11 week - performed Acceptance testing, which is the process of verifying and confirming that the software or system satisfies the requirements, expectations and needs of the customer or user.
<br>
12 week - Alpha and Beta testing activities.
