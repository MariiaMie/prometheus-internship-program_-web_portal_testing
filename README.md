Below, I will present the short description of each week.
</p>
<br>
<p>
1 week - we analysed the importance of the first-level requirements using the Fibonacci scale; and evaluated the second-level requirements for their consistency with the logic according to the evaluation criteria.
</p>
<br>
<p>
2 week - developed initial test documentation (test plan) for the overall organisation of the testing process.
</p>
<br>
<p>
3 week - get acquainted with the developed version of the portal and check the MVP (minimum viable product) for compliance with the customer's requirements, which were agreed upon during the first sprint, and determine what initial tests should be performed for the MVP of the portal.
</p>
<br>
<p>
4 week - creating test coverage based on the test scenario developed during Sprint 3, which includes the process of determining which parts of the programme code have been executed.
</p>
<br>
<p>
5 week - performed smoke-testing of the initial version of the portal and wrote a report on the test results.
</p>  
<br>
<p>
6 week - tested the portal using the previously created test cases in Sprint 4 and described the results in Jira. We determined the complexity of the test cases and sorted them.
</p>

This testing included tests for performance, scalability, reliability, security, compatibility, and other characteristics that affect user satisfaction and overall system performance.
</p>

9 week - re-test та regression testing (perform a bug fix check and verify that no new bugs have been introduced after the fixes)
</p>
<br>
<p>
10 week - end-to-end testing of the last version (developed scenarios that cover the entire life cycle of interaction with the system, including data entry, operations, processing and output)
